/**
 * Stein's Algorithm (Binary GCD)
 *
 * Rules:
 1. gcd(0, b) = b and gcd(a, 0) = a
 2. If both a and b are even:
    gcd(a, b) = 2 * gcd(a/2, b/2)
 3. If a is even and b is odd:
    gcd(a, b) = gcd(a/2, b)
 4. If a is odd and b is even:
    gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b/2)
 5. If both are odd:
    gcd(a, b) = gcd(|a-b|/2, min(a, b))
